	Comments: Decided to not use CG numbers in the paper
		  since we need to investigate more about app
		  scalability for the input size

- best_turnaround.1k.csv
  median_turnaround.1k.csv
  worst_turnaround.1k.csv

	Best, median and worst turnaround times on CC2, Sierra, Hera
	(includes total execution time and queuing delay separately).
