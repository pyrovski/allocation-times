	# of tasks: 1024, 512, 256
	Applications: CG, EP, Sweep3d, LU, SP 
	Input sizes configured for strong scaling
	Comments: Decided to not use CG numbers in the paper
		  since we need to investigate more about app
		  scalability for the input size

- best_turnaround.1k.csv
  median_turnaround.1k.csv
  worst_turnaround.1k.csv

	Best, median and worst turnaround times on CC2, Sierra, Hera
